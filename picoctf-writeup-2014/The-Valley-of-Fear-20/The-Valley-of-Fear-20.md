# The Valley of Fear - 20

```
The hard drive may be corrupted, but you were able to recover a small chunk of text. Scribbled on the back of the hard drive is a set of mysterious numbers. Can you discover the meaning behind these numbers? (1, 9, 4) (4, 2, 8) (4, 8, 3) (7, 1, 5) (8, 10, 1)
```

The first thing that immediately came up to my mind was Sherlock Homles:Valley of Fear.That means this is going to be some kind of cipher.

After playing around with these numbers, I found out first number is paragraph, second one is the line number and last one is the position of the word.

Once I found all the words, I was able to get the flag

```
Flag:ceremonial plates
