# Common Vulnerability Exercise - 20

```
This disc is encrypted. The surprisingly elaborate password hint refers to `the CVE Identifier for a 2014 vulnerability that allowed arbitrary code execution in Firefox via a buffer overflow in a speech codec`. If you found this "CVE-ID" thingy, it`d probably be the password.
```

Not much explain other than searching for "CVE-ID."

I particularly hated this challenge so much because I wasted so much time finding "CVE-ID." But eventually I got the flag.

```
Flag:CVE-2014-1542
```
